# Format that is to be used for --pump command line option:
# 	* Lines starting with `#' are comments and are ignored. Note
# 	  that `#' must be at the starting otherwise line would be
# 	  considered as a normal line of input.
#	* Empty lines must be empty from the start, i.e. if empty lines
#	  contain extraneous spaces they will be counted as normal lines
#	  of input and thus will produce Partition-Table entries that
#	  have all the values set to 0.
#	* Lines starting with a `;' character contain the sector from
#	  which input was read in case of dumping and the sector to
#	  which output is to be written.
#	* Extra tabs and spaces in normal lines are ignored.
#	* Each Partition-Table entry can span only a single line.
#	* While pumping the values given are of no concern to the
#	  program (except for the purpose of writing of course;).
#	  Checking them for validity is beyond the scope as far as
#	  GNU/LiPE is concerned.
#	* Also while pumping correct sign bytes are written and you
#	  shouldn't worry about that.
#	* In general use the output from --dump command-line option and
#	  edit it to your own liking instead of starting from scratch.
#	* You can dump a single Partition-Table and subsequently pump
#	  that single Partition-Table using --no-follow command-line
#	  option. This way it is easier to manage the output. And indeed
#	  you have the ncurses mode in any case :)
